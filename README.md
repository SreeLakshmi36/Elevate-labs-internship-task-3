# Task 3 – SQL Data Analysis

This task involved performing SQL-based analysis on the sales dataset using MySQL.  
The dataset used was **cleaned_sales_data.csv**, which was imported into a MySQL database named **salesdb**.

Two tables were used in this task:
- **cleaned_sales** – detailed sales transactions
- **monthly_sales** – monthly aggregated sales created from the main table

Steps
- Created a MySQL database and imported the cleaned dataset into a proper table structure.
- Performed data exploration using SELECT, filtering, sorting, and grouping techniques.
- Compared the use of **WHERE** vs **HAVING** for filtering aggregated results.
- Generated monthly summaries and created a separate **monthly_sales** table.
- Applied different types of SQL **JOINs** to combine the sales table with the monthly summary table.
- Created a SQL **VIEW** for easy access to monthly aggregated data.
- Analysed sales patterns such as product performance, customer details, and monthly trends using SQL.

Summary
Task 3 demonstrates the use of MySQL for real-world data analysis, including data loading, aggregation, joins, views, and summarization.  
It shows how SQL can be used to understand sales performance and derive useful insights from structured data.
